# Argos-board
Project Argos board protoype, based on Atmel TCP example

This project is based on Atmel Studio example project for TCP communication with SAMG55 Xplained PRO and WINC1500

'main.c' was modified to suit project needs
'ATM90E26.c' provides variables and functions to operate with the ATM90E26 measurement chip
'memoria.c' provides variables and functions to operate with a flash memory
The same applies to 'main.h', 'ATM90E26.h', and 'memoria.h'

All other files remains unmodified from the original Atmel Studio example project
